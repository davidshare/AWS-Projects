# AWS Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects and tools for automating infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform.

## Overview

The primary goal of this repository is to leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and modern automation tools to streamline the deployment and management of AWS resources. By utilizing tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, Python, and Ansible, you can efficiently provision, configure, and deploy infrastructure and applications in a consistent and repeatable manner.

## Contents

### Terraform

The `terraform` directory contains Terraform configurations for provisioning and managing various AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, VPCs, S3 buckets, and more. These configurations follow best practices and can be easily customized and deployed across multiple environments.

### CloudFormation

The `cloudformation` directory includes CloudFormation templates for defining and provisioning AWS infrastructure resources. These templates can be used to create and manage resources like VPCs, ECS clusters, RDS instances, and more.

### Python

The `python` directory contains Python scripts and modules for automating various tasks and interacting with AWS services using the AWS SDK or other libraries. These scripts can be used for tasks such as data processing, resource management, or custom tooling.

### Ansible

The `ansible` directory includes Ansible playbooks and roles for configuration management and application deployment across AWS resources or instances. These playbooks can be used to consistently configure and deploy applications across multiple environments.
